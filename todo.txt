-How many contracts for minting NFTs & escrow? SEPARATE ESCROW AND HORN NFTS
  NFT contract must communicate with SEPARATE escrow contract in order to approve transfers
-Access control in ESCROW ctrct will be necessary to make sure buyer funds cannot be withdrawn after purchase
-Build website
-Find a way to create addresses on-chain? for ease of use (boomer users don't need to know they are using blockchain) 

Write escrow contract!

check syntaxes of implementations

review mappings, probably need a nested mapping?
 -differentiate horns for sale vs horns owned by owners
 -Do horns need to be burned when sold? PROBABLY NOT
   -if so, how do you burn non fungible tokens within a mapping?

review events, probably need to use an ENUM to track paid/shipped/received status

write more tests, think more about UX

import openzeppelin dependencies

Figure out:
 how to accept ERC20 token deposits (stables ie USDC, USDT, DAI) in ESCROW smart contract 
 how to use NFT contract to listen for deposits of said stablecoins (to mark as paid & initiate shipping)
 how to list NFT horn prices vs auctions (look at OPENSEA)
